## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Before/after diff for quick fix preview (not summary text): user wants to see exactly what changed
- Cursor-line-only for Notes: minimal scope — fix just the line under cursor, not surrounding text
- All incompatible apps get end-of-text cursor: consistent behavior across all AX-limited apps
- Full comparison table in settings: users must understand local vs LLM trade-offs to make informed choices
